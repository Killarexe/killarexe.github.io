**Pokemon Mix est mon tout premier jeu que j'ai fait** avec **RPG Maker XP** et un vieux kit de developpement de jeu Pokemon nomm√©e *Pokemon essencials*.

I've even made a launcher to execute different versions of this game. But around 6 months or 1 year later *(I don't know exactly)* I abandonned it beacause it was to big for a 1st project.

I have still the source code of this game but it's soo broken that I don't want to share it. But maybe I'll do a post about it.

Here is the trailer of this game *(In french)*:

This is really cringe. Really, really cringe...
