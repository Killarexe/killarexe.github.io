# About

**Little Rage is one of my biggest project in my entire carieer.**

This game is a Solo platformer game based on speedrun and race. Made with the Godot game engine.

**You can unlock skins, hats and more** by trying to make your best time in the levels. Also **you can share and make levels with the integrated level editor in the game!**

This game took a long path to finish. First is went from Unity to a custom game engine, to Godot.
