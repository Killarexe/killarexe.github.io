# About

This is one of my crasyest project I've made.

Glass 4.0 is a video game library for SFML made by [**CodeNoodles**](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeNoodles) for his projects. Unfortunately, [**the official repo**](https://github.com/OfficialCodeNoodles/Glass-4.0) of this library include the header files and the libraries files for Windows only. So made this library open-source using only the header files. *(With the help of AI)*

I've never touched SFML and C++ before so it was a pretty cool and refreshing project!
