# About

**Game of Life GB** is a port of [Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/) for the Nintendo Game Boy using [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and the [hUGEDriver](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver) for the music.

This game gives a 20x18 recursive cell grid with the ability to pause/unpause, edit, clear grid and randomize grid.

Thanks to this project, I've learned how to make games structures and hardware based optimizations.
And I always wanted to port something for the Game Boy.
