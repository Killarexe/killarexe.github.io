# About

**Negative-N is my first Minecraft Mod project.** And for this I used called [**MCreator**](https://mcreator.net/). Witch is a software I still recommend to learn if you want to get into Minecraft Modding if you know nothing about coding.

This Minecraft mod adds a *new universe to Minecraft* and this universe adds mobs, minerals, exploration, adventure, crafting, blocks with interesting properties, technology, decoration, structures, a new mode of survival, nostalgia and beauty and more!

This project got a *Fabric version* but it's totaly uncomplete. *(And will never be finished.)*
