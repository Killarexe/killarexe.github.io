## About 

Copper Extension is a simple Minecraft Mod for **Forge and Fabric** witch adds a few features to the copper set...

I thought that Minecraft didn't add to much features for the copper. So that's why I've made this mod.

The major feature is the rusty copper ingots. **Copper ingots can now be oxidixed in the inventory or even when you dropped it. And also they can be waxed** using beehives or honeycombs...
