# About

Donut3DS is a small Nintendo 3DS Homebrew witch is a port of [**Wii Donut**](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Wii_Donut). This app is just a spining 3D ASCII Donut with a background music called *Addiction* by Jogeir Liljedahl.

I made this project just because I wanted to learn low level programming and developping on specialized devices like the Nintendo 3DS.
