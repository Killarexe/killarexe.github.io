<p><b>Pokemon Mix is my first game I've ever made</b> using <b>RPG Maker XP</b> and an old kit to make a Pokemon game called <i>Pokemon essencials</i>.</br>
I've even made a launcher to execute different versions of this game. But around 6 months or 1 year later <i>(I don't know exactly)</i> I abandonned it beacause it was to big for a 1st project.</br>
I have still the source code of this game but it's soo broken that I don't want to share it. But maybe I'll do a post about it.</br>
Here is the trailer of this game *(In french)*:
