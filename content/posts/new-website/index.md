**Hello everyone!**

Finally, after 6 months, I'm makeing this time a *good* and *clean* website...

I decided to switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Blowfish module](https://blowfish.page/), witch is mutch better than pure HTML + CSS + JS *(at least for me).*

## What I'll do on this website?

I'll share all my [musics here]() and also my [programing projects](), and all of this will be like a portfolio of everything I've done during the past **5 years**. I've done many things during this time and I didn't talked a lot about them...

## More details

For this site I use the [Everblush theme](https://everblush.github.io/) witch is my favorite color palette ever. I use it everywere. On my Linux config, Neovim config, Discord, Godot, and even on my oscilloscope views. *(sounds a bit I'm like a linux tech femboy, but I'm not...)*

Well hope you'll enjoy this website with me!
